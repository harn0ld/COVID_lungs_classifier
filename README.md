# COVID-19 LUNG DETECTION PROJECT

## Overview
This project focuses on **bi-dimensional signal processing and deep learning for COVID-19 detection**. It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify lung X-ray images** into **COVID-19, normal, and viral pneumonia cases**. The implementation is done using **TensorFlow/Keras in Google Colab**.

## Key Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Normalized and prepared lung X-ray images for model training.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implemented **CNN-based classification** for detecting COVID-19.
- **Dataset Handling**: Processed labeled data (COVID, normal, pneumonia cases).
- **Model Evaluation**: Used **confusion matrices, accuracy reports, and classification metrics**.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Utilized cloud-based GPU resources for training.

## Technologies Used
- **Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)**
- **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras, CNNs)**
- **Image Processing (Normalization, Feature Extraction)**
- **Google Colab for experimentation**

## What I Learned
- **Image Classification with CNNs**: Developed expertise in **deep learning for medical image analysis**.
- **Bi-dimensional Signal Processing**: Applied **preprocessing techniques** for lung X-ray data.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implemented CNNs and analyzed performance with **confusion matrices and accuracy reports**.
- **Data Augmentation & Handling**: Processed and balanced datasets for optimal performance.

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess lung X-ray images.
2. Train a **CNN model** for COVID-19 classification.
3. Evaluate performance using **confusion matrices and accuracy metrics**.
4. Deploy the trained model for real-world detection.
